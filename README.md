The task tracker is a web application that allows users to keep track of their tasks and manage them effectively. Users can create tasks, set deadlines, add descriptions, and mark tasks as completed. The application provides a user-friendly interface to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as view them in a list or grid format.

The key features of our task tracker application will include:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and authenticate themselves to access their tasks. This will ensure that each user has a personalized task management experience.

Task Management: Users can create new tasks, assign them a title, set deadlines, add descriptions, and mark them as completed. They can also edit and delete tasks as needed. Tasks can be categorized or organized into different groups or projects for better organization.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter tasks based on various criteria such as status (completed or pending), due date, priority, or assigned project. Sorting options will allow users to order tasks based on priority, due date, or any other relevant criteria.

User Interface and Styling: We'll focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using modern design principles and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI. The application should be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

Backend Integration: We'll leverage the knowledge of Express.js and MongoDB to build the backend for our task tracker application. This will involve creating API endpoints to handle user authentication, task creation, modification, and deletion, as well as data storage and retrieval from the MongoDB database.

Throughout the development process, we'll make use of the concepts we've learned, including React components, state management with Redux, handling form submissions, and making API requests to interact with the backend.

Our goal is to build a functional and polished task tracker application that showcases the power of React, Redux, Express.js, and MongoDB working together.
